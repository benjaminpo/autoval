## üìñ Current Documentation

All active documentation has been consolidated into the main **`README.md`** file in the project root, which includes:

- ‚úÖ **Complete project overview**
- ‚úÖ **Installation & setup instructions** 
- ‚úÖ **API documentation with examples**
- ‚úÖ **Deployment guide (Vercel + Render)**
- ‚úÖ **Development & contributing guide**

## üóÇÔ∏è Why These Were Archived

These files were moved to archive because:
- **Redundancy**: Information was consolidated into main README
- **Process docs**: Development process documentation (not user-facing)
- **Historical value**: Preserved for reference but not needed day-to-day
- **Clean structure**: Keeps root directory focused on essential files
